Saerny | سعرني 🚀
Saerny is a comprehensive financial tracking application designed to provide users with real-time market data. It specializes in the Egyptian market context by bridging the gap between global market prices and local purchasing power.

🌟 Key Features
✨ Precious Metals Tracker: Live updates for Gold (24K, 21K, 18K) and Silver prices, including global Ounce spot rates.

₿ Crypto Dashboard: Real-time tracking of major cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, USDT).

🍔 The "Big Mac" Converter: A unique economic tool that calculates the "fair value" of the Egyptian Pound (EGP) against the US Dollar (USD) based on the Big Mac Index (Purchasing Power Parity).

📊 Smart Analytics: Visual charts to track price fluctuations over time.

🧠 The Big Mac Logic
Unlike standard currency converters, Saerny uses the Big Mac Index—a lighthearted yet widely recognized economic indicator—to show users if the EGP is undervalued or overvalued compared to the USD based on the cost of a McDonald's Big Mac in Egypt versus the United States.
